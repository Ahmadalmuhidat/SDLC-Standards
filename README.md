# My Custom Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
This repository contains my own Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which I have built and refined through extensive work experience. The SDLC follows a structured approach covering the essential phases of:
- **Business**
- **Planning**
- **Designing**
- **Development**
- **Testing**
- **Deployment**

Each phase is crucial to ensuring a successful software development process, and this SDLC has been customized to ensure efficiency, collaboration, and high-quality software delivery.

## SDLC Phases
The process is divided into the following key phases:
### 1. **Business**
This phase focuses on the business case and strategy for the project. It includes creating proposals and using tools like Lean Canvas to validate the business idea, also a general proposal template for general project and technical proposal for customized project.
### 2. **Planning**
During this phase, we gather project requirements, set objectives, identify stakeholders, and create a roadmap for the project.
### 3. **Designing**
In this phase, the architecture of the solution is defined. This includes both high-level and detailed design documents for the software.
### 4. **Development**
The actual coding and implementation of the software take place here, following the design documents.
### 5. **Testing**
This phase includes all activities related to verifying the functionality, performance, and security of the software through different types of testing (e.g., unit, integration, system, and user acceptance).
### 6. **Deployment**
After successful testing, the software is released into the production environment. This phase ensures a smooth transition and includes post-deployment checks and monitoring.

## Documentation
The file `SDLC.docx` explains each phase in detail and provides guidance on how to navigate through the SDLC. It describes the purpose of each phase, the expected outcomes, and best practices to follow for each step in the lifecycle.

## Templates
For each phase of the SDLC, there are predefined templates that must be filled out to document decisions, milestones, and deliverables. These templates ensure consistent and comprehensive documentation throughout the lifecycle of the project.
